# CUEOriginal

Pulls audio from CUE and processes it into WAV files. This code is also **extendible** to games that use HCA/ACB/AWB compression. Only thing to edit is the directory names in the ```startprocess.py``` and ```adbpull.bat``` files.

## Special Thanks
The code uses the following repositories:

- Deretore (/deretore/): [link](https://github.com/OpenCGSS/DereTore)

The code also uses the following programs:

- ADB (/platform-tools/): [link](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads)
- LAME MP3 Encoder (/lame/): [link](https://lame.sourceforge.io/)

All copyright from the use of the programs mentioned goes to the respective copyright holders.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Notes
- This currently works on Windows only due to use of ```.bat``` files. Cross-compatibility is planned later.
- To have the program convert extracted files to ```.mp3```, edit the following on line 17 of ```startprocess.py```:
```mp3=1``` â†’ ```mp3=0```

## Steps (New):
1. *Start init.bat* (Simple enough)
3. Clean processing folder of stray .wav files

## Current things to do:
1. Cut down on number of scripts to run
3. Creation of switches using getOpt or sys.argv
<br/>a. Break each sector into functions and execute based on switches
4. ~~Handle file modifications -> Don't have to since its a hash based system for awb/acb~~
5. Handle file extraction location
<br/>a. Save extraction locaton to file also -> Handle later due to fast push
6. Clean code by changing lots of constants to variables
7. Make cross-compatibility by delivering full Python script/C#
